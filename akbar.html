        Akbar's tomb i the tomb of the Mughal emperor Akbar. It was built in 1605–1613 by his son, Jahangir and is situated on 119 acres of grounds in Sikandra, a suburb of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.

 <br><b>Location :- </b>
It is located at Sikandra, in the suburbs of Agra, on the Mathura road (NH2), 8 km west-northwest of the city center. About 1 km away from the tomb, lies, Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani, his favourite wife,[1] who after the death of Akbar laid a large garden around his tomb[2] and was later buried there by her son, Jahangir.

<br><b>History :- </b>

After Akbar's death, his son Jahangir planned and completed the construction of his father's tomb in 1605–1613. It cost 1,500,000 rupees to build and took 3 or 4 years to complete.[3] Mariam-uz-Zamani, after the death of her husband, Akbar, laid a large garden around his tomb.[2]

During the reign of Aurangzeb, Jats rose in rebellion under the leadership of Raja Ram Jat. Mughal prestige suffered a blow when Jats ransacked Akbar's tomb, plundering and looting the gold, jewels, silver, and carpets.[4] The grave was opened and the late king's bones were burned.[5][6]

As Viceroy of India, George Curzon directed extensive repairs and restoration of Akbar's mausoleum, which were completed in 1905. Curzon discussed the restoration of the mausoleum and other historical buildings in Agra in connection with the passage of the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act in 1904, when he described the project as "an offering of reverence to the past and a gift of recovered beauty to the future". This preservation project may have discouraged veneration of the mausoleum by pilgrims and people living nearby.[7]

<br><b>Architecture :- </b>
The south gate is the largest, with four white marble chhatri-topped minarets, which are similar to (and pre-date) those of the Taj Mahal, and is the normal point of entry to the tomb. The tomb itself is surrounded by a walled enclosure 105 m square. The tomb building is a four-tiered pyramid, surmounted by a marble pavilion containing the false tomb. The true tomb, as in other mausoleums, is in the basement.[8] The buildings are constructed mainly from a deep red sandstone, enriched with features in white marble. Decorated inlaid panels of these materials and a black slate adorn the tomb and the main gatehouse. Panel designs are geometric, floral and calligraphic, and prefigure the more complex and subtle designs later incorporated in Itmad-ud-Daulah's tomb.[9][10]

     <p style="text-align: justify;"><h2><b>The Architecture of Akbar Tomb</b></h2>
    </p>
    Akbar Tomb Sikandra is the perfect example of the assimilation of various styles of architecture representing the culture and history of the Mughals in India. This tomb is housed in a large walled garden on the Delhi-Agra road. The arabesque embellishments with floral designs and the use of colored marbles crowned with four elegant minarets in white marble, will surely leave you awe-struck and mesmerize your senses. The beauty of the tomb is surely grand and the calligraphic decorations on the edifice are one of a kind.
    
    
    Unlike any other Mughal tombs, the tomb of Akbar the Great is faced towards the east rather than facing towards Mecca. The basement where the remains of Akbar are kept is not open for tourists. It is said that it contains precious, expensive jewels and weapons.
    Akbar’s tomb inculcates a vintage blend of Hindu, Christian, Islamic, Jain and Buddhist styles of architecture, an iconic mixture of the positivity of different cultures.
    
     <br><b>Gateway for the Tomb :-</b>
    The gateway for the tomb is the most magnificent of any monument in the country. The beautiful charbagh (four gardens) leads to this pyramidal structure of the tomb of Akbar. The mausoleum is located on the outskirts of Agra city and houses the mortal remains of the Mughal emperor. The building contains 5 storeys. The tomb is constructed of red sandstone except for the top storey that is made of marble.

    <br><b> Ground Storey :-</b>
    The ground storey, the central courtyard of the tomb, is enclosed by arches and piers and is divided into bays roofed in the trabeate pattern. There is a square platform at the centre of the courtyard over which the white marble cenotaph is created. The large panels of intricately crafted jali (filigree) form the outer wall of the verandah from all four sides.
    
  <br><b>   Grave of Akbar :-</b>
    The grave of Akbar lies in the basement of the tomb that can be reached through a portico that is covered with stucco paintings in gold, green, and blue and have Persian inscriptions on them. Sikandra is considered as the most impeccable of all the Mughal buildings. The tomb of Akbar represents the Islamic influence amalgamating different styles and blending them into one. Rajputana and the Gothic style of architecture can also be witnessed at the tomb.
    
    The sleek, awesome and conscious attractiveness of the architecture of the premises of the tomb of Akbar truly steals the heart of anyone who visits this place. You will feel gratitude looking at the monument whatever be its ambiguous history.
